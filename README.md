# Multi-TE SANDI
Implementation of multi-TE SANDI for relaxation-diffusion MRI data analysis.

This repository contains the first code for the analysis of multi echo time (multi-TE) diffusion-weighted MRI data as presented in Ting Gong, CM Tax, Matteo Mancini, Derek K Jones, Hui Zhang, Marco Palombo, "Multi-TE SANDI: Quantifying compartmental T2 relaxation times in the grey matter", 2023 International Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine annual meeting & exhibition, abstract: #766 (https://archive.ismrm.org/2023/0766.html).
