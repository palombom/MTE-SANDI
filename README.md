# Multi-TE SANDI
Implementation of multi-TE SANDI for relaxation-diffusion data analysis 

This repository contains the first code for the analysis of multi echo time (multi-TE) diffusion-weighted MRI data as presented in Ting Gong, CM Tax, Matteo Mancini, Derek K Jones, Hui Zhang, Marco Palombo, "Multi-TE SANDI: Quantifying compartmental T2 relaxation times in the grey matter", 2023 International Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine annual meeting & exhibition, abstract: #766 (https://archive.ismrm.org/2023/0766.html).

## Dependencies
A MATLAB distribution with the Parallel Computing Toolbox, the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox and the Optimization Toolbox. Additionally, you will also need the SANDI Matlab Toolbox (https://github.com/palombom/SANDI-Matlab-Toolbox-Latest-Release) and an external repository that is already included in the SANDI Matlab Toolbox:
* [Tools for NIfTI and ANALYZE image] Jimmy Shen (2022). Tools for NIfTI and ANALYZE image (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797-tools-for-nifti-and-analyze-image), MATLAB Central File Exchange. Retrieved April 16, 2022.

## Download 
If you use Linux or MacOS:

1. Open a terminal;
2. Navigate to your destination folder;
3. Clone MTE-SANDI:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/palombom/MTE-SANDI.git
```
4. Add the MTE-SANDI folder and subfolders to your Matlab path list. 
5. You should now be able to use the code.
